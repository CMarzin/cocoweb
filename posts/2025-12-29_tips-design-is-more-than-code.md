Karri Saarinen from Linear talk about his vision of design. Design is about finding the right problem the feature you build needs to answer that problem. 

I think with all the new AI tool we will have an enormous amount of slop and this is where a product with the right design will shine even more.

Local model are very capable now for side projects. I just don’t know how these people can spend so much on Claude or Cursor, I got the cursor 20$ /month and since the start of the year I never hit the limits !

{% anchorSection "🤖", "2025 LLM Year in Review" %}[2025 LLM Year in Review](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/){% endanchorSection %}
I agree with everything in this article, we are only at the premise of what we can do with LLM, 2026 will be interesting.
