## Web Performance
- Performance tip: don't forget to dedupe your modules!
In many cases, you may be loading the same package multiple times
Try `npm dedupe` or `npx yarn-dedupe` to ensure you shed unneeded duplicates

CSS Tip ðŸ’¡
Use a dynamic line separator that changes from horizontal to vertical depending on flex-direction. No need for width or height. Just a stretched CSS border!
