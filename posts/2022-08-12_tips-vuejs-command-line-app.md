## Repo GitHub

[Temir](https://github.com/webfansplz/temir) is a Vue for interactive command-line apps.

[Temir](https://github.com/webfansplz/temir) provides the same component-based UI building experience that Vue offers in the browser, but for command-line apps. It uses  [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga)  to build Flexbox layouts in the terminal, so most CSS-like props are available in Temir as well. If you are already familiar with Vue, you already know Temir. Since Temir is a Vue renderer, it means that most of the features of Vue are supported. Head over to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)  website for documentation on how to use it. Only Temir‚Äôs methods will be documented in this readme.
