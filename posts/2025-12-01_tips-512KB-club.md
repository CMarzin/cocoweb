{% anchorSection "🎩", "512KB Club" %}[512KB Club](https://512kb.club/){% endanchorSection %}
I have optimized my site to be part of the 512KB club.
Instead of 1.3MB, 973KB of fonts + 363KB of favicon +  the rest.
My site is now only 67.75KB compressed and 115KB uncompressed.
If your site is bigger there is the [1MB Club](https://1mb.club/).
