[The Rise Of The State Machines](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/rise-state-machines/)
Quick summary : The UI development became difficult in the last couple of years. That is because we pushed the state management to the browser. And managing state is what makes our job a challenge. If we do it properly, we will see how our application scales easily with no bugs. In this article, we will see how to use the state machine concept for solving state management problems.

[XState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate) is a JavaScript and TypeScript [finite state machines (opens new window)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) and [statecharts (opens new window)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642387900359/pdf)  for the modern web.

[Lyra](https://github.com/nearform/lyra) ðŸŒŒ Fast, in-memory, typo-tolerant, full-text search engine written in TypeScript.

[Solid](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) is a declarative JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Instead of using a Virtual DOM, it compiles its templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions. Declare your state and use it throughout your app, and when a piece of state changes, only the code that depends on it will rerun.
