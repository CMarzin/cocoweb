 🧞 [Why DHH retired from tech crusade](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-i-retired-from-the-tech-crusades-107a51ea)
[David Heinemeier Hansson](https://world.hey.com/dhh) write about how a crusade to convince anyone your tech stack is superior is futile. His best argument for Ruby on Rails was a video of him showing how his stack worked and just that, no comparison with others language or stacks, just a demo of the stacks.
They will always be debate about how do you do X,Y,Z, the beauty  of the web is we have so many things to choose from, so lets just choose whatever is best for you and don’t convince people you have the best answer for everything.

✨[CSS Cap Unit](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-cap-unit/)
[Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/) write about the css Cap unit, this unit match the uppercase height of the text. Very useful when you have to add an icon which match the height of the text.

📚 [General pupose interfaces](https://modemworks.com/research/general-purpose-interfaces/)
What if an AI agent was the one using our devices instead of us ? In this article, the researchers demonstrate some possibility of using AI as a single interface between us and our digital tools.
We would talk, show everything to the AI agent and it will respond by consulting our calendar, respond to our mail etc. GTP-o is a glimpse of what G.P.I will look like in 5-10 years from now.

📗 [The :user-valid and :user-invalid pseudo-classes](https://web.dev/articles/user-valid-and-user-invalid-pseudo-classes?hl=en)
One example sometimes is better than a 1000 words essay -> [Validation Constraint Pseudo-Classes Demo - :user-valid, :user-invalid](https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/wvNJGrO)
