💎 [The One-Person Framework in practice](https://bramjetten.dev/articles/the-one-person-framework-in-practice)
This is the story of the technical founder of PlanGo, which build a **seven-figure business with Rails** alone on the technical side. Rails used the right way, with convention over configuration in mind is capable to scale and support a business without a big technical team. Hats off Bram Jetten for this.

☹️ [I hate my portefolio](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-hate-my-portfolio-d9f6f1d18574)
Valeria Yakovchik talk about the struggle to build, maintain and update a portfolio to show your skills and projects. She talks about the pression we put on ourselves to build a portoflio, because we are our own client we are harscher and more demanding, it put us in a massive stress just for a portefolio.

The conclusion is to be kinder with yourself, you can’t please everybody and even you can’t make everything perfect for you. ♥️

😉 [You Can Be a Great Designer and Be Completely Unknown](https://www.chrbutler.com/you-can-be-a-great-designer-and-be-completely-unknown)
Fame is not equal to skills, you can be famous and not the best in the world at what you do. A lot of great people build things and are not famous for it, keep building stuff, fame is not always the end goal.

🥳 [GSAP is now 100% FREE!](https://gsap.com/blog/3-13/)
Webflow acquired GSAP and now it is free to use for anyone even for commercial use. This best in class animation library is finally accessible for everyone.
