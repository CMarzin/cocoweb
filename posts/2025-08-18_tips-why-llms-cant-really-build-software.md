🤔 [Why LLMs Can't Really Build Software](https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software)
Because LLMs doesn’t have a clear mental model of the task they build. They don’t have a global overview of what we want to build and more importantly to maintain.

🐧 [2025: The Year of the Linux \(Omarchy\) Desktop](https://missioncontrol.uk.com/2025-the-year-of-the-linux-omarchy-desktop/)
Maybe all Linux needed was a big voice in the developper community ( DHH ) and a distro which is very easy to install and very easy to customize.
