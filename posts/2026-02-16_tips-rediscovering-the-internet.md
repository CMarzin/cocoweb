I really love this, I discovered what is a [webring](https://indieweb.org/webring?utm_source=cocoweb.fr) and I really want to be part of one :D. It's refreshing to see some stuff build by people just because they can and want to do fun stuff outside the social networks.

{% anchorSection "🇫🇷", "La suite" %}[La suite](https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr?utm_source=cocoweb.fr){% endanchorSection %}
As a french, it's very refreshing to see my gouvernement try to be more independent from the US tech. It's like «  Office 365 » but fully open source and MIT licensed. Check the [Github](https://github.com/suitenumerique/?utm_source=cocoweb.fr).

{% anchorSection "🤖", "AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It" %}[AI Doesn't Reduce Work—It Intensifies It](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it?utm_source=cocoweb.fr){% endanchorSection %}
Because with AI we can do a lot more alone, we can have multiple AI working at the same times, you can become designers, developers, product… It give us a lot more possibility on the short term. I agree with the end of the article, we need to have some « AI practice guide » in order to not burn our wings with it :).

{% anchorSection "🏹", "Outcome Engineering" %}[Outcome Engineering](https://o16g.com/?utm_source=cocoweb.fr){% endanchorSection %}
The o16g Manifesto, It was never about the code.
In the same vibes of the laws of the robotic by Isaac Asimov, it's 16 principles to interact with agentic coding.
