## Veille

A website made entirely with text and unicode [no-ht.ml](https://no-ht.ml/) in response to this article [HTML is all you need to make a website](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/html-is-all-you-need-to-make-a-website/)

[D2](https://d2lang.com/tour/intro/) is a diagram scripting language that turns text to diagrams. It stands for Declarative Diagramming. Declarative, as in, you describe what you want diagrammed, it generates the image.
