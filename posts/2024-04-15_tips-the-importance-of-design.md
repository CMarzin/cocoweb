✨ [The Importance of Design](https://medium.com/@jchatelain/the-importance-of-design-b79621f520d8)
Everything in our life is designed, here is a list of principle for creating simple and good design for your product.

📈 [Why Investing in UI Design Saves Costs, Increases Revenue and Retains Customers](https://uxplanet.org/why-investing-in-ui-design-saves-costs-increases-revenue-and-retains-customers-c762b78c0526)
**Fixing a problem with code cost 10 times more than fixing it in the design process, and 100 times more if you’re trying to fix the problem in a product that’s already been released.**
Spend a little more time thinking about your design will save you a lot of money down the line.

💵 [Dollars And Sense: The Business Case For Investing In UI Design](https://www.fastcompany.com/1669283/dollars-and-sense-the-business-case-for-investing-in-ui-design)
**Every dollar spent on UX brings in between $2 and $100 dollars in return.**
Investing in UX is 99% of the time worth it, in the long run. Like Apple or Logitech have proved, people can pay premium for a simple and UX friendly product instead of a feature rich and poor UX product.

📗 [Become a +10% engineer](https://dev.to/tlakomy/become-a-10-engineer-g78)
+10% engineer are engineer who make their peers 10% better. Instead of focusing only on making you a better engineer, you can share your knowledge to make the team grow and everyone profit from it.
