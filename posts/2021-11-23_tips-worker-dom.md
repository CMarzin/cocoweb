## Repo Github

An in-progress implementation of the DOM API intended to run within a Web Worker.

Purpose: Move complexity of intermediate work related to DOM mutations to a background thread, sending only the necessary manipulations to a foreground thread.

[GitHub - ampproject/worker-dom: The same DOM API and Frameworks you know, but in a Web Worker.](https://github.com/ampproject/worker-dom)
