## Veille

📉 [Tailwind marketing and misinformation engine](https://nuejs.org/blog/tailwind-misinformation-engine/)

Tero Piirainen discusses the development and impact of Tailwind CSS of today’s development practice. From a misinterpretation of Nicolas Gallagher's article on HTML semantics by Adam Wathan to the behemoth Tailwind it is now.

Elevate yourselves and learn some standard CSS and HTML.
