## Happy new year 🍾, web dev friends! 🧑‍💻

It’s the first news of the year 2026.
It’s been nearly 3 years since I started posting my digital watch on my little corner of the web. Time flies ✈️.
I have a lot of things planned for 2026 so stay tunned and again.

Happy new year 🍾, I wish you good health and success in what you do.

I have selected some news  from the web dev world to share.

**Have a great week.**

I really like the parallel between the industrial revolution from the start of twentieth century.
Coding was only human labour until very recently, now with AI you can make a feature, create an app without writing a single line of code. It’s now extremely easy and low cost to write sofware.

"In an era of mass automation, we may find that the hardest problem is not production, but stewardship. Who maintains the software that no one owns?"

I really love that ending, because it’s already a huge issue for open-source software.

It’s like a suite of the precedent article. With AI, the time passed to writing a feature is now thinner. So development code will be less important and design work will be more prevalent.

I really like solving problems, so if we spend less time coding and more time focused to really answer the problem, it’s a win for me. ( Even thought, I still love writing code ).

{% anchorSection "📝", "Party of One for Code Review !" %}[Party of One for Code Review !](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/party-of-one-for-code-review?utm_source=cocoweb.fr){% endanchorSection %}
A new way of looking at code review. If you are a solo developer, using an AI like Code Rabbit ( not sponsored ), can help to check our own code.

I like the way he propose to use AI review which give an overview of what the change will do to the system.

Like the title say, in 2026 I want to post more about anything. Time to spend less time reading on social media and try to do more doing.
