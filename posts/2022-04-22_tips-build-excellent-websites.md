        <b>Be the browserâ€™s mentor, not its micromanager.</b>
        <p>Give the browser some solid rules and hints, then let it make the right decisions for the people that visit it, based on their device, connection quality and capabilities. This is how they will get a genuinely great user experience, rather than a fragmented, broken one.</p>
