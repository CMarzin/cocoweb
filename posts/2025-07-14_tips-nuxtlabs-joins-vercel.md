🧐 [NuxtLabs joins Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/nuxtlabs-joins-vercel)
NuxtLabs the company founded by the creator of the Nuxt framework is acquired by Vercel, a company known to have the framework Next.js and SvelteKit. They claim to let Nuxt and Nitro open source and completely independent. I am a little skeptical about it because its very hard to use Next.js in other places than Vercel, I really hope I am wrong about them but we will see.

They will make Nuxt Studio MDC, Nuxt UI Pro, and NuxtHub Admin free for everyone which is a cool things.

👏 [A revisit of the Every Layout sidebar with :has\(\) and selector performance](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-revisit-of-the-every-layout-sidebar-with-has-and-selector-performance/)
The modern css selectors are now very powerful, with less than 15 lines of code you can make pretty decent layout.
