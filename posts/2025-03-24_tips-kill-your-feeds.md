This article advocates to create your own feed, your subscription feed from Youtube and others instead of the « for you » feed dictated by the platform. The internet should serve you, not the other way around.

📝 [How to write exceptional documentation](https://chrisnicholas.dev/blog/how-to-write-exceptional-documentation)

This article discuss the importance of how the data is used by the AI and what can we do to maintain open source data without seeing all our free work used in a way we don’t like.
