## Salut, web dev friends! 🧑‍💻

It’s my birthday, I am officialy 30 today 🥳.

Its nearly been four years that I share with the world my digital watch 🤯. Times fly so fast.
My first tips was [La Guerre de l’Art.](https://cocoweb.fr/posts/2021-10-12_tips-la-guerre-de-lart/), is in french because I wanted to write in french at first but switched to english because nearly all my articles are in english.

Maybe I will try make two versions 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 / 🇫🇷 later.

I am late but it’s my birthday SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO. ( just kidding I am chill ).

Did you ever try to browse the web when you were drunk ? Terence Elden’s try to simulate a drunk interface with css, try to click on the drunk button on his site :D.

<span id="React wants to win you back">📹</span> [React wants to win you back…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl0YWA2K2B0)
The code report of the 17th October, React compiler hit 1.0, new framework Remix and now React has his own organization instead of be part of Meta.

CSS functions, `if()`, animate to auto, custom sizing, popover & invokers API even more stuff than 2024.

<span id="The Temporal Dead Zone">🪦</span> [The Temporal Dead Zone, or why the TypeScript codebase is littered with var statements](https://vincentrolfs.dev/blog/ts-var)
TLDR, it’s because `var` statements are faster than `const` or `let` because of this **dead Zone**.
