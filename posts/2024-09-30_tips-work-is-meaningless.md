🏥 [Work is meaningless](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/work-is-meaningless/)
An article about the husband of Salma, which work in IT and nearly died because he wouldn’t let his coworkers down by taking sick days. Work is an exchange of time for money, 99% of the times your work can be done by someone else, but the someone else cannot replace you for your loved ones.
Take care of yourself ❤️

🍦 [You might not need that framework](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/you-might-not-need-that-framework/)
An article which state some of the reasons why a lot of new dev are stuck in the framework of their choice. By learning the vanilla way, you can have another tool in your toolbox and have more control and power over the tool you use.
Sometime an HTML, a CSS and a JS file is all you need for a project.

🎩 [A guide to destructuring in Javascript](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-guide-to-destructuring-in-javascript/)
A very cool concept explained really well.

📈 [Why I still blog after 15 years](https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/09/25/why_i_still_blog_after_15_years/#Why-Ive-continued-to-blog)
A blog is your little corner of the internet, you can put anything you want, try new things etc…
I think everyone need to have a little blog instead of only social network account.
