Flat design is over, welcome to **Diamorphism**. The new Airbnb design add colourful and dimensional icon to their UI. I personally love this new type of design.

The new design by Apple, not a fan firsthand but we will see.

🏰 [A Brief History of JavaScript](https://deno.com/blog/history-of-javascript)
Near 30 years of Javascript, a language created in 10 days by Brendan Eich to powers the UI of the SpaceX Dragon capsule. JS has come a long way. Now I write a lot of Typescript but still compiled to JS ;D.

Reinventing the wheel to better understand how it works is very cool sometimes.
