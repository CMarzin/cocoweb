I am really impressed by the culture at Linear of the zero-bugs policy. They put the quality of the sofware first, it benefits everyone to have a software without bugs. Maybe one day, I will work in a company who put quality above all else or maybe my own ^^.

{% anchorSection "⚡️", "Vite: The Documentary" %}[Vite: The Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmWQqAKLgT4){% endanchorSection %}
Finally, the documentary of Vite, the bundler created by Evan You the creator of Vuejs.

{% anchorSection "🧰", "The UnifiedToolchain for the Web" %}[The UnifiedToolchain for the Web](https://viteplus.dev/){% endanchorSection %}
Vite+ by Void zero the company of Evan You.
With Vite+ you can dev, build, test, lint, format, monorepo caching & more in a single dependency, built for scale, speed, and sanity.
It's the next step of Void zero, make a success of an unified toolchain for javascript where tools like Rome from facebook had failed.

{% anchorSection "🤖", "Effective context engineering for AI agents" %}[Effective context engineering for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents){% endanchorSection %}
After prompt engineering, now it's time to context engineering to take place, the major difference between the two is before the LLM'S only had our input written with a systemp prompt and the LLM'S  had to try on his own to respond to the user input.
Now, you pass specific files, documents and the LLM'S is much more accurate because it will know were to look first.
