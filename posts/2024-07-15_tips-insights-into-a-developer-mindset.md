Eshaan write about why we are more likely to procrastinate as a developer and share some thought about it. The key is to reduce the cognitive overload of your work !

📗 [On Laravel, Full-Stack JavaScript, and Productive Frameworks](https://www.jplhomer.org/posts/on-laravel-full-stack-javascript-and-productive-frameworks/)
Some thoughts about whether Laravel/Rails  are better than Full-Stack javascript framework.
TLDR :
- JS is cheap to host, immensely better for the frontend, but its difficult to navigate between the bundler, the different runtime and the endless list of ORM.
- Laravel/Rails are more expensive to host, the syntaxe are « verbose » and they lack of tooling.
