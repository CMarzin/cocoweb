## Salut, web dev friends! 🧑‍💻

I am excited to share my first npm package [🚀 Release 3.0.0 : Typescript all the way · CMarzin/cli-mr-creator](https://github.com/CMarzin/cli-mr-creator/releases/tag/3.0.0), I started this package when I was a student 5 years ago to learn scripting with node because bash didn’t love me :(

Now, the package is fully open source with an MIT license, Typescript support, I wrote some tests with vitest, It use Github actions for the CI and changeset for publishing to npm.

Anyway here are the news :

🫠 Programming sucks
✨ Nuxt 4.0

🫠 [Programming Sucks](https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks)
A great analogy on programming, we don’t lift or pick heavy objects but we are required to destroy our mental health for the job instead. I love programming but sometimes I think you need to be crazy to do this job. 

✨ [Announcing Nuxt 4.0 · Nuxt Blog](https://nuxt.com/blog/v4)
The main features for me is the new project structure and the better typescript support.

📗 [How to create a NPM Package](https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-create-an-npm-package)
I didn’t use a first this tutorial for creating a NPM package but I used it to make my package [CMarzin/cli-mr-creator](https://github.com/CMarzin/cli-mr-creator/releases/tag/3.0.0) more modern with CI, tests, TypeScript and changeset.

👀 [Changelog - Laravel 12.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans](https://laravel.com/docs/changelog)
