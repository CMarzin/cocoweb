I just love the design of the website.
The story is fun but maybe before trying to see the sunset in a national park in the winter, check the road and if it's possible hahaha.

{% anchorSection "💔", "A Broken Heart" %}[A Broken Heart](https://allenpike.com/2026/a-broken-heart/?utm_source=cocoweb.fr){% endanchorSection %}
Did you know [Apple Color Emoji](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/apple-color-emoji/?utm_source=cocoweb.fr) is a font ? And Font can have colors too ? Allen Pike found a bug inside Safari which render the heart emoji. Safari browser don't like the [Noto Color Emoji - Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji?utm_source=cocoweb.fr).

« (L)ots of (L)ittle ht(M)l page(S). »
