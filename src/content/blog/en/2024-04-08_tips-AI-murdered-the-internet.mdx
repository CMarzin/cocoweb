Now that generative AI is nearly mainstream, the internet is filling up quickly with fake and low quality content. The cost to produce bullshit article or spamming SEO is near zero so now the human internet is getting buried over by generative AI. Even YouTube for kids is filled now by poor quality video for toddlers.
