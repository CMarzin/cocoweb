📚 [Write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)
Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. They have a lots of tips, tutorial, a slack ( 21k+ members ) and conferences to help you write documentation.
Come joins us to write the docs of the future.

🫡 [I'm giving up on open source](https://nutjs.dev/blog/i-give-up)
The maintenir of [nutjs.dev](https://nutjs.dev/) a desktop automation tool, write his letter of resignation about open source. Again another example of how hard it is to live from open source.
If you use open source code, consider helping the mainteneer they deserve it :).

🗣️ [No hello](https://nohello.net/en/) ->  [🇫🇷 version](https://nohello.net/fr/)
A little guide to make asynchronous conversation better. Avoid saying only **hello** on a chat, put some context, some humour 😁.

🎨 [Iconists](https://www.lottielab.com/iconists)
A beautiful collection of animated icon brought to you by the dynamic duo Andreas Storm and Martin David.

🧋 [Matcha CSS](https://matcha.mizu.sh/)
***matcha.css*** is a pure CSS library designed to style HTML elements similarly to a default browser stylesheet, eliminating the need for users to manually patch their documents.
Ideal for fast prototyping, static HTML pages, Markdown-generated documents, and developers seeking to streamline their workflow without delving into CSS intricacies and want to make use of [the full range of available HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element).
