[ubugeeei \(mononokeking\)](https://github.com/ubugeeei?utm_source=cocoweb.fr) is a japanese software engineer, member of [@Vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs?utm_source=cocoweb.fr).
He has writted a book where he explain how to recreate the framework from scratch. If want to know more about the behind the scene of this framework, it’s a must.

In the end, knowing when to stop is a very powerful skill. AI push us to do more because it can’t be tired, but if you leave everything single things to the AI you will be obsolete. I really like his idea of using AI, only the afternoon and keeping the morning to work the «  old way » in order to keep his skills sharp :).

<AnchorSection emoji="👀" id="the-engineering-guide-to-context-window-efficiency">[The Engineering guide to Context window efficiency](https://dev.to/siddhantkcode/the-engineering-guide-to-context-window-efficiency-202b?utm_source=cocoweb.fr)</AnchorSection>
Interesting way to explain the context window efficiency.

I recently discovered Tailscale, and now I think I can’t go back.
