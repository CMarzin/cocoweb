🧐 [Design System Retrospective](https://kyleshevlin.com/design-system-retrospective/)
When you create a design system, you need to think about which type of dev will have to use it.
When you make a design system which require a deep knowledge in CSS and functional composition, you need to make sure the others dev can keep up.
If not, you need to make sure they have some way to use it even if it means have crappy and slow codebase.

🧪 [Two Types of Composition](https://kyleshevlin.com/two-types-of-composition/)
Summary of the article
* Composition is combining existing elements to create new ones
* Nesting composition uses wrapping elements to modify functionality
  * Parents change the functionality of child elements
* Merging composition smashes elements together destructively to achieve new ones
  * The order of the smashing is important

🍿 [Design is politics](https://draganbabic.com/blog/design-is-politics/)
A large part of the work of a designer is convince people your design is good and it fit the context of the project.
