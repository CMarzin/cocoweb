💅 [Modernizing the CSS logo and branding](https://css-tricks.com/searching-for-a-new-css-logo/)
It’s time to refresh the look and the branding behind CSS, the current logo is the same since 2011. There is a team at the css group which work to create a new logo, branding in order to modernise our view on CSS.

Here is the most popular proposition for now :
