🤖 [The end of programming as we know it](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/)
AI will not replace programmer, it just starting to reinvent the way we program. This is the start of a new digital revolution, so AI enhanced development will led a lot of programmer to be a lot more ambitious with their projects.

🚀 [AI-enhanced development](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/)
Simon Willison’s describe a practical project which he made with the help of ChatGPT in the matter of hours/days instead of week. He build a custom system to archive his ChatGPT messages into his own server.

🤯 [AX, DX, UX](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/thoughts-on-ax/)
In the future, will it be software made specifically for « Agent experience », software specifically made for the use of AI ? To me I think we need to still concentrate in « User experience » first, « Developer experience » and maybe « Agent experience » last.

🧐 [Can You Get Better Doing a Bad Job?](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/get-better-doing-a-bad-job/)
A great point is if you know you are doing a bad job, you just forget what you did and don’t want to thinks about it in a technical point of view.

✨ [Aspect Ratio Changes With CSS View Transitions](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/aspect-ratio-in-css-view-transitions)

## Fun

📜 [Scroll buddy](https://scrollbuddy.com/)
Instead of a boring scroll bar, thought it would be fun to have an animated stick figure that walks down the page when you scroll.
