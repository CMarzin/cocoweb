🚀[Node.js Now Supports TypeScript By Default](https://www.totaltypescript.com/typescript-is-coming-to-node-23)
In Node 23, TS is supported by default without any extra configuration ! Enjoy :)

🤖 [Building Effective AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
Great writing from the Anthropic blog.
If you have enough documentation and guardrails, agents can automate coding or other workflows.

🔭 [What ’s new for Vuejs in 2025](https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/whats-next-for-vue-in-2025/)
Nuxt 4, Vite 6, Vitest 3, Pinia 3 and Vapor Mode. Things will be interesting to see in 2025 for Vuejs devs.

📗 [How to Use the Variant Props Pattern in Vue](https://alexop.dev/posts/vue-typescript-variant-props-type-safe-props/)
The Variant Props Pattern in Vue combines TypeScript’s discriminated unions with Vue’s prop system to create type-safe component variants. Instead of using complex type utilities, we explicitly mark incompatible props as never to prevent prop mixing at compile time.
