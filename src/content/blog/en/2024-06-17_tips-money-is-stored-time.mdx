## Salut, web dev friends! 🧑‍💻

I have a wonderful news, I have officially passes my Vuejs developer certifications 🥳 🥳 🥳
Many thanks to the Vuejs team and Evan You the creator of Vuejs for making such a beautiful framework.
Thanks also to my friend [Adrien Zaganelli](https://adrienzaganelli.com/) for his support during the certifications ( he also have the certification ).

Here is the link of my certificates of [Vuejs developer level 1 💚](https://certificates.dev/c/9c44c0fe-21f7-4884-9b78-dfe951d5df69).

💰 [Money is stored time](https://kartikay.bearblog.dev/money-is-stored-time/)
A new paradigm to think about time and money, if you think about it, when you buy something you buy the time it take to create it. Have you ever thinking about putting a price for your time ? For freelancers, it might be easier but as someone who as a day to day job its not so easy.

🌶️ [5 hard truths for young designers](https://vanschneider.com/blog/5-hard-truths-for-young-designers/)
TLDR : don’t wait for others to help you achieve your dream, take matter in your own hand. ( Very American point of view )

✨[Inline property condition in CSS](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10064)
A new incoming feature in the CSS language, we will soon have the ability to write code like this :
```css
background: if(style(--variant: success), var(--green));
```

🚀 [Type Predicate Inference: The TS 5.5 Feature No One Expected](https://www.totaltypescript.com/type-predicate-inference)
Typescript will be smarter, it will predicate correctly the return type of a function, no more forced return type.

🤓 [State of Frontend 2024 is out](https://stateoffrontend2024.typeform.com/survey)
In 2022 more than 4000 developer filled the survey, maybe we can do more this year.
