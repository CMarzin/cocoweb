LLM’S are just bad are spatial reasoning and when you write CSS, you also need HTML to know the result. You have an endless way of doing things with CSS so the LLM are lost in it.
TLDR : use Tailwind when telling an LLM to build some UI because its easier to match one class to one property for the LLM. ( I am not promoting Tailwind lol ).
